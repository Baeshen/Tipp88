# Tipp88

This Software is supposed to be similar to ones which teach someone to write with ten finges, but instead of an Computer Keyboard, it's aimed at musical E-Keyboards. 
The Basics of reading notes and reacting already exists, and a simple Display is also supported. Now it only needs a Display wich supports more then showing simple notes
and it should support formats which songs are stored in.
